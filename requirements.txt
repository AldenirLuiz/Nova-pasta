# Dependencies required by attendance-scanner
# Note: Tesseract OCR is a separate system binary and must be installed
# (e.g. Windows installer or apt on Linux). The project sets the tesseract
# binary path in `src/main.py`.

opencv-python>=4.7.0
pytesseract>=0.3.10

# Optional: if you run in a headless environment (no GUI), consider:
